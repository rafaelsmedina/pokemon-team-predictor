# pokemon-team-predictor

This is supposed to be an experimental project using pokémon status. 

Wait for it.

Before using: 

- sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
- sudo apt-get install postgresql
- sudo apt-get install python-dev

Up until now it is possible to:

01. See all pokémon available (from gen 1 to 7)
02. See information for each pokémon
